### External Stats Screen
Hooks onto the classic Serious Sam games and displays the current game's stats.

![Example image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple1417/external_stats_screen/master/Example.png)

Supports the current steam versions of classic TFE (v1.05), TSE (v1.07) and Revolution (AP_3381). It should work with other versions, but is untested.    
Note that this is only made for the singleplayer/coop gamemode. It will run fine in others but it may not display useful information.


Uses [MemTools](https://github.com/apple1417/MemTools).
